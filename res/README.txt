Use this directory for resources (images, sound, etc). There will also be a resources folder in src/game/. That folder is for all of the resources 
that are actively being used in the game, and will probably not be organized. If you make a resource, put it here, and then copy it to the src/game folder 
once the game is ready for the resource to be used.
