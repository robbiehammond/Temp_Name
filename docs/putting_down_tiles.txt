There are multiple "layers" for tiles. There is the ground, which 
is basically just background stuff that you can't collide with. Then 
there are boundary tiles, which are also in the background, but you can't walk through
(i.e. stuff like walls). Finally, there are Inanimate objects, these are in the foreground 
and you also cannot walk through. This is where static sprites should go. It should be pretty 
clear which layer you want your tile on, so make sure you place it on the right one for the correct
behavior.
